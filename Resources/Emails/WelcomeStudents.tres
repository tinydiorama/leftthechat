Thank you all for what was a very auspicious start to our fall semester. I am so pleased to see many of you have brought an open mind, a sense of curiosity, and a fresh enthusiasm for learning as we traverse this exploration of knowledge together. October rings in our traditional State Collegiate Fall Forum, where we host a number of seminars and social events. Don't be a stranger! These four years are a once in a lifetime opportunity for you. I encourage you to fully immerse yourself in college activities and campus life. 

On a more serious note I would like to remind you all that hazing, bullying and harassment of any kind are not tolerated at State Collegiate University. We do not want a repeat of the incident last year.

Go Ravens!

Warmly,
Dean Merryweather"
