Thank you all for a very auspicious start to our fall semester. These four years are invaluable. Be sure to approach every opportunity with an open mind, a sense of curiosity, and a fresh enthusiasm for knowledge. Tomorrow night marks our traditional Full Moon Festival, where you can enjoy various seminars and social events. Donâ€™t be a stranger!

On a more serious note I would like to remind you all that hazing, bullying and harassment of any kind are not tolerated at State Collegiate University. We do not want a repeat of the incident last year.

Go Ravens!

Warmly,
Dean Merryweather"
