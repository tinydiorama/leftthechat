Noah: Can't wait for Eternal Affliction 2!!!
James: Well, you’re going to have to wait for another 12 hours at least. 
Noah: I knoww :(
Noah: I just love their games so much
James: Eh. Personally, I’m not a fan of any of Solomon’s games post Eternal Affliction 1. He has obviously lost his touch. Death’s Redemption was trash.
Amelia: I love them! On chapter five of my Death’s Redemption fanfiction currently.
Vanessa: The walls are closing in on me.
James: What?
