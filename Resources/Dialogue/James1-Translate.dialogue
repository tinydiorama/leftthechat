@jamesthegiant: Hey, how's it going?
@jamesthegiant: I heard you were asking Calvin for help translating stuff. 
@jamesthegiant: You know I'm fluent in multiple languages. 
@jamesthegiant: English, Chinese Mandarin, Klingon... I'm proficient in a few others too.
@jamesthegiant: btw do you think Paige is OK? I know she and Vanessa were pretty close. 
@jamesthegiant: She seems aggro most of the time but idk. 
@jamesthegiant: You think she needs a shoulder to cry on??
